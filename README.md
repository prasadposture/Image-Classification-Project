<h1 align="center">Image Classification Project</h1>
<h3>Introduction :</h3>
The project was associated with ‘Artificial Intelligence Course’ offered by
MyCaptain. It contains machine learning algorithm written for classification of the images of
handwritten digits. It uses Random Forest Classifier and classifies the images with great
accuracy.<br>
In a supervised learning algorithm, a set of input data and its response data (output) is fed to
the machine. The machine is thus trained to generate reasonable predictions for the response
to new(future) data. Therefore, the image classification is a supervised learning problem.

<h3>Random Forests :</h3> Random forests or random decision forests are used for both classification
and regression. In a random forest algorithm, a multitude of decision trees is constructed at
training time. The output is the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or
mean/average prediction (regression) of the individual trees

<h3>Dataset:</h3> The dataset used here is obtained from the Kaggle datasets. It contains images of
handwritten digits in the csv file. The data is already processed, doesn’t have any missing
values, so that saves lot of time.

<h3>Source :</h3>https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
<h3>Shape :</h3> The dataset has 42000 rows and 785 columns
<h3>Calculation of Accuracy :</h3>
1. Test Data Size (Total Number of Predictions) = 8400<br>
2. Correct Number of Predictions = 8090<br>
3. Accuracy = 0.9630952380952381
